The code in this repository draws to the screen on the PS1.  It was written by Julian Goldsmith starting in December 2014, and modified periodically through June 2016.

The most recent changes started to bring in the GTE, the PS1's math coprocessor, but I didn't get to the point of being able to use it properly.

There used to be a file, sys.S, which contained stubs for system calls; I don't remember off-hand where it came from, so I haven't included it in this repository.
